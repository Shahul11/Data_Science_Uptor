### Evaluating the Performance of a Decision Tree Model
Once a decision tree model has been fit to data, we need to evaluate its performance to determine how well it is able to make predictions. There are several metrics that can be used to evaluate the performance of a decision tree model, including accuracy, precision, recall, and the F1-score.

- **Accuracy:** The fraction of correct predictions made by the model.

- **Confusion matrix:** A table that summarizes the number of true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative predictions made by the model.

- **Precision:** The fraction of positive predictions that are actually positive.

- **Recall:** The fraction of actual positive cases that were correctly predicted as positive by the model.

- **F1-score:** The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
