# Introduction to Decision Trees

Decision trees are a popular supervised learning algorithm that are used for
both Classification and Regression problems.

They are called decision trees because they represent a tree-like model of decisions
and their possible consequences.

A tree/algorthim starts with a single node, called the root,
and recursively splits the data into smaller and smaller subsets based
on the feature that provides the most information gain.

Each split results in a new node in the tree, and the process continues until a stopping
criterion is met such as maximum tree depth or
minimum number of samples in a leaf node.

## Classification

In classification problems, each leaf node of the decision tree represents a class label,
