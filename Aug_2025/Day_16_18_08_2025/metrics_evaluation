Types of Model:
1.  Regression
    1.1: Matric evaluation
        1.1.1:  r2_score
                Expected value for r2 score should be between 0 to 1
                Poor accuracy =0.01 to 0.75
                Good Accuracy  > 0.75
                Over Fitting = 1.0

        1.1.2:   mean_squared_error
                 expected value is as less possible.

        NOTE:  This mean_squared_metric cannot be applied for all the data set

For difference between y_test and y_predict is small mean_squared model is fitted

2.  Classification
        2.1 accuracy_score
        2.2 confusion matrix
        2.3 classification report
        2.4 precision
        2.5 f1_score
        2.6 recall

        Note: Metrics 2.3 classification report contains report of all the other metrics

        Different ways of finding metrics:
            1.



1.  Why model should be train and tested?
    when we fit(training) the modal with complete x and y data model may end up in overfitting
    So to avoid the over fitting we split data into 70:30  or 80:20 ratios

2.  How do we know the data is underfitted or over fitted
        Ths can be found by metrics evaluation
        Any accuracy with exact 1.0  output is over fitting
        Any accuracy with exact 0.0 output is underfitting

3.  How to overcome this underfitting and overfitting?
        This can be overcome by concept of regularization.
            L1. Regularization (lasso) - For overfitting
            L2. Regularization (Ridge) - For underfitting



Note:
    This regularization can be applied only on the non-parametric model

4.  What is parametric and non-parametric model?
        A model that assumes the column based linear relationship  is said to be parametric (Line and Logistic Regression)

        A model that assumes the column based linear relationship and also row based importance is said to be
        non parametric(Tree Model, KNN)


Note: Parametric  Based on data distribution
        Non- Parametric - distribution free


5.  What should we do when the accuracy is poor


What should we do for poor accuracy score(0 to 0.5)?

Method1:Cross validation

1.Check the data set sampling,It picks the data randomly so,sometimes
trained data might be poor and test data will be strong.It tends to give poor accuracy.
2.To overcome above issue ,we should cross validate data
3.The cross validation will do different sampling with different subset.
4.Let say,CV=5(means,my dataset will be having 5 different samplings).
5.Each sample will produce accuracy score.
6.[0.9,0.89,0.91,0.9,0.88]
7.from the above sample output,it is very evident that model is performing same subsets
   7.1. If in  this case,CV=5 produce poor accuracy score .so it is very
        evident that model is performing poorly with different subset.
   7.2  [0.9,0.3,0.89,0.35,0.9]
   7.3 Now here two results producing poor accuracy score.so it is very
       evident that model is performing poorly with different subset.
   7.4Now we conclude that dataset is not worth for accuracy
