Visualization
--------------
Concept of  representing data in the form of graph
why it is easier to understand thru graph view than data view


Libraries used for visualization
1. matplotlib (primary)
2.seaborn (primary)
3.plotly
4.dash

Types of Visualization
 1. Univariate  - only one column is needed
 2. Bivariate  - two column is needed


Note:
 1: Generally graph used in visualization is 2 dimensional data
 2: Visualization can be applied in any phase of the modal
 3: One of the pre-process concept of machine learning is EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
 4: EDA can be used for finding outliers (abnormal data) and many more applications we use it

 Types of plot: (applicable for both seaborn and Matplotlib)
 1. Scatter Plot (number vs number)
 2. Box Plot (Univariate - numerical data)
 3. Pie chart (numerical vs categorical - % based )
 4. Bar Plot (categorical vs numerical - aggregation)
 5. HeatMap (correlation - Any column variance)
