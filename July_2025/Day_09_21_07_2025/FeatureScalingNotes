=====================
How to find only the columns that has data type as object

Feature Scaling
===============
Transforming one numerical data to another numerical data is feature scaling
In scenarios like - when visualising the data for number of olympic medals between US and Nepal,
the data range difference is huge to scale it in a view, so we encode the numerical data to fit in the view

when should we go for this feature scaling?
For the models that use distance based manipulation/algorithm
Examples - KNN (K Nearest Neighbour), Kmeans clustering(unsupervised learning)

Feature scaling can be done in two ways
1. Normalisation -
==================
This is process of converting existing numerical data into normalised numerical data.
The term 'Normalised data' means distribution of data falls under uniform distribution.

from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler

output will always be between 0 to +1

2. Standardization -
====================
This is process of converting existing numerical data into normalised numerical data.
The term 'standardised data' means distribution of data falls under normal distribution.

from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

output will always be between -1 to +1


Notes: Datas generally falls under two kinds of distribution.
1. Normal distribution : based on mean/average (sin wave/bell curve)
2. Uniform distribution : based upon equally spread data on flat scale (rectangle)

Analogy for normal distribution:
students can distributed above and below average
Analogy for uniform distribution:
students are distributed by departments (no specifications)
